      And lastly, thank you sa lahat beh for always there for me even in my lowest time supporting me 
      and cheering me sa mga ginagawa ko, though my time na yung mga comment mo nakakainis but still I'm 
      trying to think na yun yung way mo para pagaanin yung loob ko, especially on my stress nights and days.
      Thank you for msking me happy sometimes eme hahaha, pero still you're trying to make me smile, even though
      may time na down ka na talaga and you have a problem pa. Like I said i-ssave ko sana yung message ko 
      d2 sa letter mo, imbis na sa vm nung naglaro tayo, pero I'll repeat nlng. Even in your toughest times,
      you're always make yourself strong infront of your families and others. Sometimes you need pag d mo na 
      kaya, it's okay to let it go ilabas mo lng yung hinanaing sa kalooblooban mo, mahirap mag panggap na okay
      ka hmmm. Pag d mo na kaya ilabas mo muna yan, take a deep breath and relax a little. As always all ears
      ako, if you need someone to talk I'm here though I don't really know what's happening pero I'm just
      here to open my ears to listen to your rants and problems. Okay don't push yourself and don't be hard
      on yourself. Take yourself din, so it will be resolve soon. There's a reason why it's happening to us, 
      when we face a lot of struggles and challenges in life. Be tough and you can do it. so ayun hehhehehe.
